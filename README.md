# Chat APP

In this Android chat application, we are using Kotlin as the programming language and Firebase Realtime Database for storing and retrieving data. The real-time database enables us to build a dynamic and responsive chat system that updates in real-time.

Additionally, the app implements push notifications to alert users of new messages even when the app is not in the foreground. The integration of Firebase makes it easy to implement these features while also providing a scalable and secure solution. With this combination of technologies, the chat app provides a smooth and seamless user experience.
